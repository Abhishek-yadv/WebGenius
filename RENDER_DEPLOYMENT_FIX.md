# Fix for Render Deployment Error

## The Problem
The error you're seeing is related to Rust compilation issues with `pydantic-core==2.14.1`. This happens because:
1. Render's free tier has limited build resources
2. The newer pydantic version requires Rust compilation
3. The build environment has read-only filesystem issues

## The Solution
I've updated the dependencies to use more compatible versions:

### Updated `backend/requirements.txt`:
- **Downgraded pydantic** from `2.5.0` to `2.4.2` (avoids problematic pydantic-core version)
- **Added pip upgrade** in build command for better compatibility

### Updated Build Configuration:
```yaml
buildCommand: "pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r backend/requirements.txt && python -m playwright install chromium"
```

## How to Apply the Fix:

### Option 1: Update Existing Service
1. **Go to your Render service dashboard**
2. **Go to Settings tab**
3. **Update Build Command** to:
   ```
   pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r backend/requirements.txt && python -m playwright install chromium
   ```
4. **Trigger Manual Deploy**

### Option 2: Create New Service (Recommended)
1. **Delete the failing service** (if it keeps failing)
2. **Create a new Web Service** with the updated configuration
3. **Use the new `render-backend-only.yaml` file** I created

## Environment Variables to Set:
```
PORT=10000
PYTHONPATH=/opt/render/project/src
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/render/project/.playwright
```

## Expected Build Time:
- **5-10 minutes** for the full build
- **Playwright installation** takes the longest (3-5 minutes)
- **First deploy** is always slower

## Testing After Deployment:
Once deployed successfully, test these URLs:
- `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/api/health`
- `https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/docs`

## If It Still Fails:
1. **Check the build logs** for specific error messages
2. **Try deploying again** (sometimes Render has temporary issues)
3. **Consider upgrading to paid plan** for more build resources
4. **Contact me** with the new error message if different

The updated dependencies should resolve the Rust compilation issue you encountered.
